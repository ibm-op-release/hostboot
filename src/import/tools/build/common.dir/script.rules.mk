# Makefile that defines how we build generated files, often from scripts that
# process other content in the repository, such as XML files.

# BUILD_GENERATED
#    This macro will automatically generate all the recipes for running a tool
#    that generates other files.  Requires that the following variables are
#    defined prior to calling this macro:
#       * GENERATED=name - Give a name to this generator.
#       * COMMAND=tool - Name of the tool to run.
#       * SOURCES=file1 file2 - List of files as 'input' to the tool.
#       * TARGETS=file3 file4 - List of files that are created as 'output'.
#       * $(GENERATED)_RUN - A macro that identifies how to run this tool.
#    Special variables:
#       * $(GENERATED)_PATH - Optional path to put output into.
#       * $(GENERATED)_COMMAND_PATH - Path to tool, assumed to be the current
#                                     directory of the .mk file if not given.
#    Input:
#       * Optional input to delay the running of BUILD_GENERATED macro to a
#       later phase  EXE or MODULE.
#
BUILD_GENERATED = $(eval $(call __BUILD_GENERATED,$1))

# Order of operations:
#   * Define _PATH and _COMMAND_PATH if they do not exist.
#   * Define a recipe for a $(GENERATED).built timestamp file.
#      - Depend on $(COMMAND) and $(SOURCES)
#      - Ensure $(GENERATED)_PATH output path exists.
#      - Call $(GENERATED)_RUN macro.
#      - Touch timestamp file.
#   * Add dependency from TARGETS to .built timestamp file.
#   * Add timestamp and TARGETS to 'clean' target.
#   * Add timestamp to GEN_TARGETS.
#   * Clear out GENERATED, COMMAND, SOURCES, and TARGETS variables.
